# Description
We are multiplying two rectangular matrices filled with random 3-digit integers, a matrix A of size 300x500, and a matrix B of size 500x200. The resulting matrix C is of size 300x200.

# Output
All programs output processing time taken by the matrix multiplication operation in milliseconds. Commented out sections include code for printing the contents of matrix A, B, or C.

# Note
Parallel programs include basic and tiled computations of the matrix multiplication operation.
